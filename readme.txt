Super lightweight, simple, nice, modern looking and effective social sharing and following buttons and icons on your site without the extra burden

== Description ==

[WordPress Social Media Feather](http://synved.com/wordpress-social-media-feather/ "Lightweight WordPress social sharing and following") is a super lightweight free social media WordPress plugin that allows you to quickly and painlessly add **social sharing and following** features to all your posts, pages and custom post types.

The primary goal behind the plugin is to provide very lightweight WordPress social sharing and following that doesn’t add any unnecessary burden to your site and especially on your users.

What sets WordPress Social Media Feather aside from the plethora of other social sharing and following WordPress plugins is its focus on simplicity, performance and unobtrusive impact.

In order to achieve this the plugin makes no use of JavaScript and as a consequence it’s **really fast** while still providing all the social media functionality you might need.

By keeping load times at a minimum, you ensure that all the social sharing aspects of your site don’t interfere with those visitors who just want to access the content but are not interested in sharing on social platforms.

On the other hand, given the widespread focus on WordPress social media integration, your site will still provide social bookmarks to improve visibility of your posts and content and improve your overall global reach.

The WordPress social media sharing offered by the plugin includes all major social sharing providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, reddit, Pinterest, Linkedin and even e-mail.

The plugin also offers widgets for sharing and following buttons that you can place in any widgetized area in your site. Widgets also expose some settings to tweak appearance.
